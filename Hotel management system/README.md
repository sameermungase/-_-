# Hotel Reservation System Project

## Project Title
Hotel Reservation System

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a hotel reservation system that allows users to search for available rooms, make reservations, and view booking details. The system is designed to be user-friendly and includes features such as room categorization and payment processing. This project is a part of the tasks assigned during the CodeAlpha internship.

## Features
- **Check Room Availability**: Users can check if a specific room is available.
- **Make Reservations**: Users can reserve available rooms.
- **Cancel Reservations**: Users can cancel existing reservations.
- **Room Categorization**: The system can be extended to categorize rooms (e.g., Single, Double, Suite).
- **Payment Processing**: The system can be integrated with a payment gateway for processing payments.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The main programming language used for the project.
- **HashMap**: Used to manage the room reservations.
- **Scanner**: Used for user input in the console-based application.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from the desired source.
2. **Compile the Code**: Ensure you have Java installed, then compile the code using the following command:
   ```
   javac HotelManagementSystem.java
   ```
3. **Run the Application**: Start the application by running:
   ```
   java HotelManagementSystem
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the application in the terminal.
2. Select from the menu options to:
   - Check the availability of a room.
   - Reserve a room.
   - Cancel a reservation.
   - Exit the system.
3. Follow the prompts to enter room numbers and perform desired actions.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement room categorization (e.g., Single, Double, Suite).
- Integrate a payment gateway for handling reservations.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Add user authentication and booking history features.
